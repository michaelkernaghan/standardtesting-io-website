# Standard Testing

Welcome to the Standard Testing repository, your hub for exploring validator nodes, intelligent contracts, and innovative user experiences within the decentralized world.

## Etherlink Integration

Our projects are integrated with Etherlink, a platform that bridges the gap between blockchain networks and everyday applications. Etherlink provides a seamless interface for users to interact with blockchain technologies without understanding the underlying systems' complexities.

By leveraging Etherlink, we aim to simplify the user experience without compromising on the power and security offered by blockchain technology. For more information about Etherlink, visit [Etherlink's homepage](https://etherlink.io).

## Smart Contracts on Sepolia

Our smart contracts are deployed on Sepolia, a test network that allows developers to experiment and test new Ethereum features before they are released on the mainnet. This ensures our contracts are thoroughly vetted and optimized for performance.

The BOOPS and TORQUE tokens and our NFT collections are stored on Sepolia contracts, which interact with marketplaces like OpenSea for seamless NFT trading. You can explore these contracts and the NFTs stored on the [Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io).
